User friendly QX UI

### Details

QX, as a very useful smart contract, facilitates seamless swapping of Qubic's diverse assets. Despite its utility, the platform has faced consistent feedback from the community regarding its lack of a stable and user-friendly interface. Traders have long requested a reliable UI that matches their expectations and trading habits.

Currently, Qubic is in the process of developing a new UI for QX. While this is a promising step forward, the interface remains under development and is not yet available for public use. In the meantime, traders have expressed the need for a more intuitive and familiar interface resembling traditional exchange platforms they are accustomed to.

A few weeks ago, Neuron99 introduced Min-QX, the first iteration of a user interface for QX. Although it was simple and electron-based, it represented a significant step forward, giving traders an initial platform to interact with QX. Seeing the potential of this project, I tried to enhance and modernize it by updating the UI, integrating TypeScript, and implementing a more flexible architecture.

To provide an even better experience for traders and address their expectations, the platform requires further development to incorporate features akin to classical exchanges. These enhancements include:

- Price Chart Integration: A real-time price chart for traders to track market trends and asset performance.
- Classical Orderbook Display: A familiar order book interface showing live buy/sell orders.
- Traditional Exchange UI: Designing the interface to resemble platforms like Binance or MEXC for a seamless transition for users.
- Wallet Connect Functionality: Enabling secure wallet integration for effortless transactions.
- Notification System: Providing real-time updates for trades, market changes, and system events.
- Detailed Information Panel: Displaying relevant asset data, market insights, and transaction history.
- Comprehensive Error Handling: Ensuring the system gracefully manages errors with clear feedback for users.
- Enhanced Security Measures: Implementing best practices to safeguard user data and transactions.
- Additional Features: Exploring further improvements based on community feedback and evolving needs.
